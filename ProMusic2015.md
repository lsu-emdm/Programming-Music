## Programming Music 2015

[Programming Music 2015](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/ProMusic2015) 

A mixture of science and the arts in a one-week camp designed for high schoolers. Supported by the LSU Center for Computation & Technology as part of their Cultural Computing focus, this course incorporated computer programing into a musical performance.

Programming in javascript to live code music in a web browser. Students made their own web audio instruments in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Music topics on composition, form, and notation were covered as groups formed to create live-coded musical performances. Final projects were presented and pieces performed at the concert at the conclusion of the week.
