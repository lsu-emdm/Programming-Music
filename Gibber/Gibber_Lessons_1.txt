/* Programming Music 1
Welcome to Gibber!
The first thing we need to know is how to 
execute code. Move your cursor to 
line six and press "control + enter" */
a = Sine(440)

/*Great! Now press "control + period"
as you can see in the bottom of the browser
"Gibber has been cleared." 
To execute more than one line of code, 
place the cursor on a line and press 
"alt + enter" Try it on line 15 */ 

a = Sine(330)
b = Drums('x.o.*.-.')
/* both code in line 15 & 16 are executed
Say you want to stop the tone, but not the 
Drums :execute line 22, followed by 23
and finally 24 (use "command + enter") */

a.disconnect()
a.connect()
a._ //short and easy to type!

/*If we want to change the drum pattern
without interuupting the one in progress:
Execute line 30, Use "shift + control + enter"*/

b=Drums('xo**-...')

/* Look in the top right of the browser,
see where it says "gibber" and the grey block moves
with the drums? when we use "shift+ctl+enter" gibber
waits until the start of beat one (leftmost postion)
to implement the executed code. This is very useful
when executing code musically. 

Try executing a new drum pattern with "ctl+enter" */
b=Drums('x***o---') //it interrupts the pattern!

/*When "ctl+enter" is used to execute code gibber 
ignores the beats of it's internal metronome,
adding "shift" to "ctl+enter" or "alt+enter" uses
the internal clock to synchronize the sound to the
next 'downbeat'

Remember You can always press "control & period" to
clear gibber entirely.
