# Intro to Musical Coding with Tone.js

# Concepts
Object Orienting Programming
Javascript

# Timing with Tone.js
Time (Music is time based. Interesting things should happen in relation to time)
Transport object methods setInterval(), setTimeout(), setTimeline()

# Let's Code!
Create an oscillator
Create an oscillator with a filter
How do we route audio?

Create a noise generator with a filter
Adjust the filter over time

Let's use enveloping on the oscillator, on the noise 

Let's create an array of oscillators or noise generators

## Let's get complicated!
FM, AM, Sampling

Add reverb
Add panning
